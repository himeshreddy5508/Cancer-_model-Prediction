# 🧬 Cancer Diagnosis Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting **cancer diagnosis** using machine learning techniques.
The goal is to classify whether a tumor is **benign or malignant** based on medical features provided in the dataset.

A **Logistic Regression** model is used after proper data preprocessing and feature scaling.

## 📂 Dataset

- **Target column:** Diagnosis
- **Features:** Numerical medical attributes related to cancer detection

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## ⚙️ Steps Involved
1. Importing libraries
2. Loading the dataset
3. Data preprocessing
4. Train-test split
5. Model building using Logistic Regression
6. Model evaluation

## 📊 Model Used
- Logistic Regression

## ✅ Results
